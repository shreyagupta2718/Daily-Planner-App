# My Personal Project: Daily Time-Blocking Planner

This project will be useful to anyone who wants a
simple application to **plan and visualize**
their day. It allows users to brain dump 
activities for the day, called **blocks**, on the left column. These blocks can then be added
to the day's calendar (titled **schedule**) on the right column. 
This project is of interest to me
because I used a similar planning system with a physical notebook
during high school
and have not found a free application that does this exact thing. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a block (representing an activity) 
to my brain dump, which is the list of activities for the day
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of blocks on my brain-dump
- As a user, I want to be able to assign a length (in time) to each block and visualize it as a rectangle of
 corresponding height
- As a user, I want to be able to move a block from the brain-dump to the schedule and vice-versa
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a block
